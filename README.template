## Introduction
`suffixC` is a simple C program to align a fastq against a shortish reference sequence (around 10kb) using a suffix tree allowing for a small number of mismatches. Partial alignments are preserved in a separate file, useful for finding chimeric reads. It is most useful as a prefilter to pull out reads for alignment using a slower, more accurate program.
